# Speed up document display

To speed up the document display, use commands in the View menu to turn off
rendering-quality features that require extra computing and slow down document
display.

None of these commands have any effect on how Flash Pro exports a document. To
specify the display quality of Flash Pro documents in a web browser, use the
`object` and `embed` parameters. The Publish command can do this for you
automatically.

following options:

Outlines  
Displays only the outlines of the shapes in your scene and causes all lines to
appear as thin lines. This makes it easier to reshape your graphic elements and
to display complex scenes quickly.

Fast  
Turns off anti-aliasing and displays all the colors and line styles of your
drawing.

Antialias  
Turns on anti-aliasing for lines, shapes, and bitmaps and displays shapes and
lines so that their edges appear smoother on the screen. Draws more slowly than
the Fast option. Anti-aliasing works best on video cards that provide thousands
(16‑bit) or millions (24‑bit) of colors. In 16‑ or 256‑color mode, black lines
are smoothed, but colors might look better in Fast mode.

Antialias Text  
Smooths the edges of any text. Works best with large font sizes and can be slow
with large amounts of text. This is the most common mode in which to work.

Full  
Renders all content on the Stage fully. Might slow down display.

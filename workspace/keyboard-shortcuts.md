### Customize keyboard shortcuts

1.  Select Edit \> Keyboard Shortcuts (Windows) or Flash \> Keyboard Shortcuts
    (Macintosh).

    The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box appears.

2.  Use the following options to add, delete, or edit keyboard shortcuts:

    **Current Set**  
    Lets you choose a set of predetermined shortcuts (listed at the top of the
    menu), or any custom set you've defined.

    **Commands**  
    Lets you select a category of commands to edit (for example, menu commands).
    The command list displays the commands associated with the category you
    selected from the Commands pop‑up menu, along with the assigned shortcuts.
    The Menu Commands category displays this list as a tree view that replicates
    the structure of the menus. The other categories list the commands by name
    (such as Quit Application), in a flat list.

    _Shortcuts_  
    Displays all shortcuts assigned to the selected command.

    **Add Shortcut**  
    ![](../img/add_path.png) Adds a new shortcut to the current command. To add
    a new blank line to the Shortcuts box, click this button. To add a new
    keyboard shortcut for this command, enter a new key combination and click
    Change. Each command can have two different keyboard shortcuts; if two
    shortcuts are already assigned to a command, the Add Item button does
    nothing.

    **Remove Shortcut**  
    ![](../img/remove_path.png) Removes the selected shortcut from the list of
    shortcuts.

    **Press Key**  
    Displays the key combination you enter when you're adding or changing a
    shortcut.

    **Change**  
    Adds the key combination shown in the Press Key box to the list of
    shortcuts, or changes the selected shortcut to the specified key
    combination.

    **Duplicate Set**  
    ![](../img/duplicate_scene.png) Duplicates the current set. Give the new set
    a name; the default name is the current set's name with the word _copy_
    appended to it.

    **Rename Set**  
    ![](../img/rename_set.png) Renames the current set.

    **Export Set As HTML**  
    ![](../img/export_set_html.png) Saves the current set in an HTML table
    format for easy viewing and printing. Open the HTML file in your browser and
    print the shortcuts for easy reference.

    **Delete Set**  ![](../img/Trashcan.png) Deletes a set. You cannot delete
    the active set.

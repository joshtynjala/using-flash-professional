# Find and Replace in Flash

## About Find and Replace

The Find and Replace feature lets you do the following:

- Search for a text string, a font, a color, a symbol, a sound file, a video
  file, or an imported bitmap file.

- Replace the specified element with another element of the same type. Different
  options are available in the Find and Replace dialog box depending on the type
  of specified element.

- Find and replace elements in the current document or the current scene.

- Search for the next occurrence or all occurrences of an element, and replace
  the current occurrence or all occurrences.

> **Note:** In a screen-based document, you can find and replace elements in the
> current document or the current screen, but you can't use scenes.

The Live Edit option lets you edit the specified element directly on the Stage.
If you use Live Edit when searching for a symbol, Flash Pro opens the symbol in
edit-in-place mode.

The Find and Replace Log at the bottom of the Find and Replace dialog box shows
the location, name, and type of the elements for which you are searching.

## Find and replace text

1.  Select Edit \> Find and Replace.
2.  Select Text from the For pop‑up menu.
3.  In the Text box, enter the text to find.

5.  Select options for searching text:

    **Whole Word**  
    Searches for the specified text string as a whole word only, bounded on both
    sides by spaces, quotes, or similar markers. When Whole Word is deselected,
    the specified text can be searched as part of a larger word. For example,
    when Whole Word is deselected, a search for _place_ will yield the words
    _replace_, _placement_, and so on.

    **Match Case**  
    Searches for text that exactly matches the case (uppercase or lowercase
    character formatting) of the specified text when finding and replacing.

    **Regular Expressions**  
    Searches for text in regular expressions in ActionScript. An expression is
    any statement that Flash Pro can evaluate that returns a value.

    **Text Field Contents**  
    Searches the contents of a text field.

    **Frames/Layers/Parameters**  
    Searches frame labels, layer names, scene names, and component parameters.

    **Strings in ActionScript**  
    Searches strings (text between quotation marks) in ActionScript in the
    document or scene (external ActionScript files are not searched).

    **ActionScript**  
    Searches all ActionScript, including code and strings.

## About templates

Flash Pro templates provide you with easy-to-use starting points for common
projects. The New File dialog box provides a preview and description of each
template. Templates are available in six categories:

- Advertising - these include common Stage sizes used in online ads.

- Animation - these include many common types of animations, including motion,
  highlighting, glow, and easing.

- Banners - includes common sizes and functionality used in website interfaces.

- Media Playback - includes photo albums and playback of several video
  dimensions and aspect ratios.

- Presentations - includes simple and more complex presentation styles.

- Sample Files - these provide examples of commonly used features in Flash Pro.

#### A note about advertising templates

Advertising templates facilitate the creation of standard rich media types and
sizes defined by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and accepted by the
online advertising industry. For more information on IAB-endorsed ad types, see
the IAB site at IAB.net.

Test your ads for stability in various browser and platform combinations. Your
ad application is considered stable if it doesn't cause error messages, browser
crashes, or system crashes.

Work with webmasters and network administrators to create detailed test plans
that include the tasks you expect your audience to do within the ad. Example
test plans are available at the IAB Rich Media testing section of IAB.net. Size
and file format requirements of ads can vary by vendor and website. Check with
your vendor, ISP, or the IAB to learn about these requirements that affect the
ad's design.

# Check spelling

You can check spelling in text throughout your Flash Pro document. You can also
customize the spell checker.

## Use the spell checker

1.  Select Text \> Check Spelling to view the Check Spelling dialog box.

    The box in the upper-left corner identifies words not found in the selected
    dictionaries, and also identifies the type of element that contains the text
    (such as a text field or frame label).

2.  Do one of the following:

    - Click Add To Personal to add the word to your personal dictionary.

    - Click Ignore to leave the word unchanged. Click Ignore All to leave all
      occurrences of the word in the document unchanged.

    - Enter a word in the Change To box or select a word from the Suggestions
      scroll list. Then click Change to change the word or click Change All to
      change all occurrences of the word in the document.

    - Click Delete to delete the word from the document.

3.  To end the spelling check, do one of the following:

    - Click Close to end spelling before Flash Pro reaches the end of the
      document.

    - Continue checking spelling until you see a notification that Flash Pro has
      reached the end of the document, then click No to end spelling checking.
      (Click Yes to continue the spelling check at the beginning of the
      document.)

## Customize the spelling checker

1.  Do one of the following:

    - Select Text \> Spelling Setup. (Use this option if you have not used the
      Check Spelling feature before.)

# Drawing preferences

Set drawing settings to specify snapping, smoothing, and straightening
behaviors. Change the tolerance setting for each option, and turn each option
off or on. Tolerance settings are relative, depending on the resolution of your
computer screen and the current magnification of the scene. By default, each
option is on and set to Normal tolerance.

## Drawing settings

1.  Select Edit \> Preferences (Windows) or Flash \> Preferences (Macintosh) and
    select Drawing.
2.  Under the Drawing category, select from the following options:

    **Pen tool**  
    Lets you set options for the Pen tool. Select Show Pen Preview to display a
    preview line from the last clicked point to the current location of the
    pointer. Select Show Solid Points to display control points as small filled
    squares instead of unfilled squares. Select Show Precise Cursors to display
    a crosshair cursor instead of the Pen tool icon when using the Pen tool.
    This option lets you see the exact target of clicks more easily.

    **Connect Lines**  
    Determines how close the end of a line being drawn must be to an existing
    line segment before the end point snaps to the nearest point on the other
    line. This setting also controls horizontal and vertical line
    recognition—that is, how nearly horizontal or vertical a line must be drawn
    before Flash Pro makes it exactly horizontal or vertical. When Snap To
    Objects is turned on, this setting controls how close objects must be to
    snap to one another.

    **Smooth Curves**  
    Specifies the amount of smoothing applied to curved lines drawn with the
    Pencil tool when the drawing mode is set to Straighten or Smooth. (Smoother
    curves are easier to reshape, whereas rougher curves match the original line
    strokes more closely.)

    > **Note:** To further smooth existing curved segments, use Modify \>
    > Shape \> Smooth and Modify \> Shape \> Optimize.

    **Recognize Lines**  
    Defines how nearly straight a line segment drawn with the Pencil tool must
    be before Flash Pro recognizes it as a straight line and makes it perfectly
    straight. If Recognize Lines is off while you draw, straighten lines later
    by selecting one or more line segments and selecting Modify \> Shape \>
    Straighten.

    **Recognize Shapes**  
    Controls how precisely to draw circles, ovals, squares, rectangles, and 90°
    and 180° arcs for them to be recognized as geometric shapes and redrawn
    accurately. The options are Off, Strict, Normal, and Tolerant. Strict
    requires that the shape be drawn very close to straight; Tolerant specifies
    that the shape can be somewhat rough, and Flash redraws the shape. If
    Recognize Shapes is off while you draw, straighten lines later by selecting
    one or more shapes (for example, connected line segments) and selecting
    Modify \> Shape \> Straighten.

    **Click Accuracy**  
    Specifies how close to an item the pointer must be before Flash Pro
    recognizes the item.

## Selection, Subselection, and Lasso tool contact options

Specify the Selection, Subselection, and Lasso tool contact-sensitivity options
when you create shapes using Object Drawing mode. By default, objects are only
selected when the tool's marquee rectangle completely surrounds the object.
Deselecting this option selects entire objects when they are only partially
enclosed by the selection marquee of the Selection, Subselection, or Lasso
tools.

1.  Select Edit \> Preferences (Windows) or Flash \> Preferences (Macintosh).
2.  In the General category, do one of the following:

    - To select only objects and points that are completely enclosed by the
      selection marquee, deselect Contact-Sensitive Selection and Lasso tools.
      Points that lie within the selection area are still selected.

    - To select objects or groups that are only partially enclosed by the
      selection marquee, select Contact-Sensitive Selection and Lasso tools.

      > **Note:** The Subselection tools use the same contact-sensitive setting.

# Apply patterns with the Spray Brush tool

The Spray Brush acts like a particle sprayer, letting you "brush" a pattern of
shapes onto the Stage at one time. By default, the Spray Brush emits a spray of
dot particles using the currently selected fill color. However, you can use the
Spray Brush tool to apply a movie clip or graphic symbol as a pattern.

1.  Select the Spray Brush tool.

2.  In the Spray Brush tool Property inspector, select a fill color for the
    default spray of dots. Or, click Edit to select a custom symbol from the
    library.

    You can use any movie clip or graphic symbol in the library as a "particle."
    These symbol-based particles give you a great deal of creative control over
    artwork you create in Flash.

3.  Click or drag on the Stage where you want the pattern to appear.

## Spray Brush tool options

The Spray Brush tool options appear in the Property inspector when you select
the Spray Brush from the Tools panel.

Edit  
Opens the Select Symbol dialog box, from which you select a movie clip or
graphic symbol to use as a spray brush particle. When a symbol in the library is
selected, its name appears next to the edit button.

Color selector  
Select a fill color for the default particle spray. The color selector is
disabled when you use a symbol in the library as a spray particle.

Scale  
This property only appears when not using a symbol from the Library as the
particle. Scale the symbol used as a spray particle. For example, a value of 10%
makes the symbol 10% smaller. A value of 200% makes the symbol 200% larger.

Scale width  
This property only appears when using a symbol as the particle. Scale the width
of a symbol used as a spray particle. For example, a value of 10% makes the
symbol 10% narrower. A value of 200% makes the symbol 200% wider.

Scale height  
This property only appears when using a symbol as the particle. Scales the
height of a symbol used as a spray particle. For example, a value of 10% makes
the symbol 10% shorter. A value of 200% makes the symbol 200% taller.

Random scaling  
Specifies that each symbol-based spray particle is placed on Stage at a random
scale, altering the size of each particle. This option is disabled when using
the default spray of dots.

Rotate symbol  
This property only appears when using a symbol as the particle. Rotates the
symbol-based spray particle around a center point.

Random rotation  
This property only appears when using a symbol as the particle. Specifies that
each symbol-based spray particle is placed on Stage at a random degree of
rotation. This option is disabled when you use the default spray of dots.

Width  
The width of the spray particle when not using a symbol from the Library.

Height  
The height of the spray particle when not using a symbol from the Library.

Brush Angle  
The amount of clock-wise rotation to apply to the spray particle when not using
a symbol from the Library.

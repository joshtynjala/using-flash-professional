# Moving and copying objects

## Move objects by dragging

1.  Select an object or multiple objects.
2.  Select the Selection tool ![](../img/selection.png), position the pointer
    over the object, and do one of the following:

    - To move the object, drag it to the new position.

    - To copy the object and move the copy, Alt-drag (Windows) or Option-drag
      (Macintosh).

    - To constrain the object's movement to multiples of 45°, Shift-drag.

## Move objects by using the arrow keys

1.  Select an object or multiple objects.
2.  Do one of the following:

    - To move the selection 1 pixel at a time, press the arrow key for the
      direction in which you want the object to move.

    - To move the selection 10 pixels at a time, press Shift+arrow key.

> **Note:** When Snap To Pixels is selected, the arrow keys move objects by
> pixel increments on the document's pixel grid, not by pixels on the screen.

## Move objects by using the Property inspector

1.  Select an object or multiple objects.

2.  If the Property inspector is not visible, select Window \> Properties.

3.  Enter _x_ and _y_ values for the location of the upper-left corner of the
    selection.

    The units are relative to the upper-left corner of the Stage.

    > **Note:** The Property inspector uses the units specified for the Ruler
    > Units option in the Document Properties dialog box.

## Move objects by using the Info panel

1.  Select an object or multiple objects.

2.  If the Info Panel is not visible, select Window \> Info.

3.  Enter _x_ and _y_ values for the location of the upper-left corner of the
    selection.

    The units are relative to the upper-left corner of the Stage.

## Move and copy objects by pasting

To move or copy objects between layers, scenes, or other Flash files, use the
pasting technique. You can paste an object in a position relative to its
original position.

1.  Select an object or multiple objects.
2.  Select Edit \> Cut or Edit \> Copy.
3.  Select another layer, scene, or file, and then select Edit \> Paste In Place
    to paste the selection in the same position relative to the Stage. Select
    Edit \> Paste In Center to paste the selection in the center of the work
    area.

## Copying objects with the clipboard

Elements copied to the clipboard are anti-aliased, so they look as good in other
applications as they do in Flash. This feature is useful for frames that include
a bitmap image, gradients, transparency, or a mask layer.

Graphics pasted from other Flash documents or programs are placed in the current
frame of the current layer. How a graphic element is pasted into a Flash scene
depends on the type of element it is, its source, and the preferences you have
set:

- Text from a text editor becomes a single text object.

- Vector-based graphics from any drawing program become a group that can be
  ungrouped and edited.

- Bitmaps become a single grouped object just like imported bitmaps. You can
  break apart pasted bitmaps or convert pasted bitmaps to vector graphics.

  > **Note:** Before pasting graphics from Illustrator into Flash, convert
  > colors to RGB in Illustrator.

## Copy transformed objects

You can create a scaled, rotated, or skewed copy of an object.

1.  Select an object.
2.  Select Window \> Transform.
3.  Enter scale, rotation, or skew values.
4.  Click the Duplicate Selection and Transform button
    ![](../img/copy_transform.png) in the Transform panel.

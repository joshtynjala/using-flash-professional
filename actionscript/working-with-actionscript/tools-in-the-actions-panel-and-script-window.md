# Tools in the Actions panel and Script window

The Actions panel and Script window toolbars let you access the code-assistance
features that help simplify and streamline coding in ActionScript. The tools are
different depending on whether you are using the Actions panel or the Script
window.

Add A New Item To The Script ![](../../img/add_new_item.png)  
Displays the language elements that are also in the Actions toolbox. Select an
item to add it to the script.

Find ![](../../img/find.png)  
Finds and replaces text in your script.

Insert Target Path ![](../../img/targetPathbtn.png)  
(Actions panel only) Helps you set an absolute or relative target path for an
action in the script.

Check Syntax ![](../../img/check_syntax.png)  
Checks for syntax errors in the current script. Syntax errors are listed in the
Output panel.

Auto Format ![](../../img/auto_format.png)  
Formats your script for proper coding syntax and improved readability. Set
autoformatting preferences in the Preferences dialog box, which is available
from the Edit menu or from the Actions Panel menu.

Show Code Hint ![](../../img/code_hint.png)  
If you've turned off automatic code hinting, use Show Code Hint to display a
code hint for the line of code you're working on.

Debug Options ![](../../img/debug_options.png)  
(Actions panel only) Sets and removes breakpoints so that you can proceed line
by line through your script when debugging. You can use debug options only for
ActionScript files, not ActionScript Communication or Flash JavaScript files.

Collapses code that appears between the curly braces or parentheses that
currently contain the insertion point.

Adds comment markers to the beginning and end of the selected code block.

Apply Line Comment ![](../../img/line_comment.png)  
Adds a single-line comment marker at the insertion point, or at the beginning of
each line of code in a multiline selection.

Remove Comment ![](../../img/remove_comment.png)  
Removes comment markers from the current line or all lines of the current
selection.

Show/Hide Toolbox ![](../../img/show_hide_Actions_toolbox.png)  
Displays or hides the Actions Toolbox.

Script Assist ![](../../img/script_assist.png)  
(Actions panel only) In Script Assist mode, you are presented with a
user-interface for entering the elements needed to create scripts.

Help ![](../../img/help.png)  
Displays reference information for the ActionScript element that is selected in
the Script pane. For example, if you click an `import` statement and then click
Help, the reference information for `import` appears in the Help panel.

Panel menu ![](../../img/options_menu.png)  
(Actions panel only) Contains the commands and preferences that apply to the
Actions panel. For example, you can set line numbers and word wrapping, access
ActionScript preferences, and import or export scripts.

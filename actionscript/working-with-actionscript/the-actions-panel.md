# The Actions panel

## Looking for the Language Reference?

To find reference documentation for a specific ActionScript language element, do
one of the following:

- Open the
  [ActionScript Language Reference](https://web.archive.org/web/20111117151647mp_/http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/index.html),
  and search for the language element.

- Type the language element in the Actions panel, select it, then press F1. (You
  must press F1 immediately, or this topic opens instead.)

## Overview of the Actions panel

To create scripts embedded in a FLA file, enter ActionScript directly into the
Actions panel (Window \> Actions or press F9).

A.  
Script pane

B.  
Panel menu

C.  
Actions toolbox

D.  
Script navigator The Actions panel consists of three panes:

Script pane  
Lets you type ActionScript code, which is associated with the currently selected
frame (or, for ActionScript 2 only, the currently selected object).

To keep a particular script displayed in the Script pane, pin the script by
clicking the Pin button at the bottom of the pane.

Actions toolbox  
Groups ActionScript elements by category and provides an alphabetical index. To
insert an ActionScript element into the Script pane, double-click it or drag it
directly into place in your code in the Script pane..

Script navigator  
Lists the scripts in your Flash document, and lets you move quickly between
them. Click an item in the Script navigator to view the script in the Script
pane.

To pin a script in the Actions panel, double-click it in the Script navigator.
Pinned scripts remain in the Script pane even when a different frame or object
is selected in the Timeline or on the Stage. ![](../../img/tip_help.png) To hide
the Actions toolbox and Script navigator, click the Show/Hide Toolbox
button ![](../../img/show_hide_Actions_toolbox.png) at the top of the Actions
panel. When the Actions toolbox is hidden, you can still use the Add (+) button
to access its items.

## Print ActionScript

1.  From the Actions panel pop‑up menu, select Print.

2.  Select Options and click Print.

    Because the printed copy won't include information about file it came from,
    you should include information such as the name of the FLA file in a
    `comment` in the script.

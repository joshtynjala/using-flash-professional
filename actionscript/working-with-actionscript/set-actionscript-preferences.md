# Set ActionScript preferences

Whether you edit code in the Actions panel or the Script window, you can set and
modify a single set of preferences.

1.  Select Edit \> Preferences (Windows) or Flash \> Preferences (Macintosh),
    and then click ActionScript in the Category list.
2.  Set any of these preferences:

    **Automatic Indentation**  
    When automatic indentation is turned on, the text you type after an opening
    parenthesis "(" or opening curly brace "{" is automatically indented
    according to the Tab Size setting.

    **Tab Size**  
    Specifies the number of characters a new line is indented.

    **Code Hints**  
    Enables code hinting in the Script pane.

    **Delay**  
    Specifies the delay (in seconds) before code hints are displayed.

    **Font**  
    Specifies the font used for your script.

    **Use Dynamic Font Mapping**  
    Checks to ensure that the selected font family can render each character. If
    not, Flash substitutes a font family that contains the necessary characters.

    **Open/Import**  
    Specifies the character encoding used when you open or import ActionScript
    files.

    **Save/Export**  
    Specifies the character encoding used when you save or export ActionScript
    files.

    **Reload Modified Files**  
    Specifies what happens when a script file is modified, moved, or deleted.
    Select Always, Never, or Prompt.

    **Always**  
    No warning is displayed, and the file is automatically reloaded.

    **Never**  
    No warning is displayed, and the file remains in the current state.

    **Prompt**  
    (Default) A warning is displayed, and you can choose whether to reload the
    file.

    When you build applications with external scripts, this preference helps you
    avoid overwriting a script that a team member has modified since you opened
    the application, or avoid publishing the application with older versions of
    scripts. The warnings let you automatically close a script and reopen the
    newer, modified version.

    **Syntax Colors**  
    Specifies code coloring in your scripts.

    **Language**  
    These buttons open the ActionScript Settings dialog boxes, where you can set
    a classpath for ActionScript 2.0, or a source path, library path, and
    external library path for ActionScript 3.0.

# Export QuickTime video files

Using Flash Pro, you can create QuickTime® movies (MOV files) that can be played
back by users who have the QuickTime plug-in installed on their computers. This
is often done when people use Flash Pro to create title sequences or animation
for use as video content. The published QuickTime file can be distributed as a
DVD, or incorporated into other applications such as Adobe® Director® or Adobe®
Premiere® Pro.

If you are creating a QuickTime video using Flash Pro, set your publish setting
to Flash Pro 3, 4, or 5.

> **Note:** The QuickTime Player does not support Flash Player files later than
> version 5.

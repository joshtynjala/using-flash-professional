# Working with Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects

## Working with Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Flash

Adobe Premiere Pro is a professional tool for editing video. If you use Adobe
Flash Professional to design interactive content for websites or mobile devices,
you can use Adobe Premiere Pro to edit the movies for those projects.
Adobe Premiere Pro gives you professional tools for frame-accurate video
editing, including tools for optimizing video files for playback on computer
screens and mobile devices.

Adobe Flash Professional is a tool for incorporating video footage into
presentations for the web and mobile devices. Adobe Flash offers technological
and creative benefits that let you fuse video with data, graphics, sound, and
interactive control. The FLV and F4V formats let you put video on a web page in
a format that almost anyone can view.

You can export FLV and F4V files from Adobe Premiere Pro. You can embed those
files into interactive websites or applications for mobile devices with Adobe
Flash. Adobe Flash can import sequence markers you add in an Adobe Premiere Pro
sequence as cue points. You can use these cue points to trigger events in SWF
files on playback.

If you export video files in other standard formats, Adobe Flash can encode your
videos within rich media applications. Adobe Flash uses the latest compression
technologies to deliver the greatest quality possible at small file sizes.

## Moving assets between Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Flash

In Adobe Premiere Pro, you can add Flash cue point markers to a timeline. Flash
cue point markers serve as cue points in a rich media application. There are two
types of cue point markers: event and navigational cue point markers. You can
use navigational cue point markers to navigate to different sections of FLV and
F4V files, and to trigger the display of onscreen texts. You can use event cue
point markers for triggering action scripts at specified times in FLV and F4V
files.

You can export a movie from Adobe Premiere Pro directly into the FLV and F4V
formats. You can choose from severalExport Settings presets. These presets
balance file size against audio and video quality to achieve the bit rate needed
for any target audience or device. If you export the movie with an alpha
channel, you can use the movie easily used as a layer in a rich media project.

You can import the FLV or F4V file into Adobe Flash. Flash reads sequence
markers as navigational or event cue points. In Flash, you can also customize
the interface that surrounds your video.

Alternatively, you can use Flash to create animations for use in movies. You can
create an animation in Flash. You can export the animation as an FLV or F4V
file. Then, you can import the FLV or F4V file into Adobe Premiere Pro for
editing. In Adobe Premiere Pro, for example, you could add titles or mix the
animation with other video sources.

## Working with Flash and After Effects

If you use Adobe® Flash® to create video or animation, you can use After Effects
to edit and refine the video. For example, from Flash you can export animations
and applications as QuickTime movies or Flash Video (FLV) files. You can then
use After Effects to edit and refine the video.

If you use After Effects to edit and composite video, you can then use Flash to
publish that video. You can also export an After Effects composition as XFL
content for further editing in Flash.

Flash and After Effects use separate terms for some concepts that they share in
common, including the following:

- A composition in After Effects is like a movie clip in Flash Professional.

- The composition frame in the Composition panel is like the Stage in
  Flash Professional.

- The Project panel in After Effects is like the Library panel in
  Flash Professional.

- Project files in After Effects are like FLA files in Flash Professional.

- You render and export a movie from After Effects; you publish a SWF file from
  Flash Professional.

The following articles provide additional information about using Flash and
After Effects together:

- Richard Harrington and Marcus Geduld provide an excerpt, "Flash Essentials for
  After EffectsUsers", of their book _After Effects for Flash \| Flash for After
  Effects_ on the Peachpit website. In this chapter, Richard and Marcus explain
  Flash in terms that an After Effects user can understand.

#### Exporting QuickTime video from Flash

If you create animations or applications with Flash, you can export them as
QuickTime movies using the File \> Export \> Export Movie command in Flash. For
a Flash animation, you can optimize the video output for animation. For a Flash
application, Flash renders video of the application as it runs, allowing the
user to manipulate it. This lets you capture the branches or states of your
application that you want to include in the video file.

#### Rendering and exporting FLV and F4V files from After Effects

When you render finished video from After Effects, select FLV or F4V as the
output format to render and export video that can play in Flash Player. You can
then import the FLV or F4V file into Flash and publish it in a SWF file, which
can be played by Flash Player.

#### Importing and publishing video in Flash

When you import an FLV or F4V file into Flash, you can use various techniques,
such as scripting or Flash components, to control the visual interface that
surrounds your video. For example, you might include playback controls or other
graphics. You can also add graphic layers on top of the FLV or F4V file for
composite results.

#### Composite graphics, animation, and video

Flash and After Effects each include many capabilities that allow you to perform
complex compositing of video and graphics. Which application you choose to use
will depend on your personal preferences and the type of final output you want
to create.

Flash is the more web-oriented of the two applications, with its small final
file size. Flash also allows for run-time control of animation. After Effects is
oriented toward video and film production, provides a wide range of visual
effects, and is generally used to create video files as final output.

Both applications can be used to create original graphics and animation. Both
use a timeline and offer scripting capabilities for controlling animation
programmatically. After Effects includes a larger set of effects, while the
Flash ActionScript® language is the more robust of the two scripting
environments.

Both applications allow you to place graphics on separate layers for
compositing. These layers can be turned on and off as needed. Both also allow
you to apply effects to the contents of individual layers.

In Flash, composites do not affect the video content directly; they affect only
the appearance of the video during playback in Flash Player. In contrast, when
you composite with imported video in After Effects, the video file you export
actually incorporates the composited graphics and effects.

Because all drawing and painting in After Effects is done on layers separate
from any imported video, it is always non-destructive. Flash has both
destructive and nondestructive drawing modes.

#### Exporting After Effects content for use in Flash

You can export After Effects content for use in Flash. You can export a SWF file
that can be played immediately in Flash Player or used as part of another rich
media project. When you export content from After Effects in SWF format, some of
the content may be flattened and rasterized in the SWF file.

To edit your After Effects content further in Flash, export a composition as an
XFL file. An XFL file is a type of Flash file that stores the same information
as a FLA file, but in XML format. When you export a composition from
After Effects as XFL for use in Flash, some of the layers and keyframes that you
created in After Effects are preserved in the Flash version. When you import the
XFL file in Flash, it unpacks the XFL file and adds the assets from the file to
your FLA file according to the instructions in the XFL file.

#### Importing Flash SWF files into After Effects

Flash has a unique set of vector art tools that make it useful for a variety of
drawing tasks not possible in After Effects or Adobe® Illustrator®. You can
import SWF files into After Effects to composite them with other video or render
them as video with additional creative effects. Interactive content and scripted
animation are not retained. Animation defined by keyframes is retained.

Each SWF file imported into After Effects is flattened into a single
continuously rasterized layer, with its alpha channel preserved. Continuous
rasterization means that graphics stay sharp as they are scaled up. This import
method allows you to use the root layer or object of your SWF files as a
smoothly rendered element in After Effects, allowing the best capabilities of
each tool to work together.
